            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Hongxuan Chen, and I am a fourth year PhD student in <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>. 
                I am passionate about CS education, and my research focuses on how students learn discrete mathematics and algorithm design. I am factually co-advised by <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/glherman/" target="_blank">Dr. Geoffrey Herman</a> and <a href="https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Dr. Jeff Erickson</a>.</p>
            <p>You may check my full cv <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (last updated: Jan 2025), and below are some highlights (that I am proud of).</p>

            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p>I am passionate about teaching computer science and aspire to become a teaching professor.</p>
            <p>I was a co-instructor for CS 233 Computer Architectures at UIUC in Spring 2024 with Morgan Fong, under the supervision of Dr. Geoffrey Herman, long-time instructor of that course.
                Morgan and I were in charge of every aspect of the course with a cohort size of around 280 students. Student performance was at the same level, if not better, compared with past semesters.
                More importantly, I got to practice my skills of class and team management, public speaking, communication and connection with students, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>I also had experience working as a graduate teaching assistant for CS 233 and CS 173 (Discrete Mathematics), and undergraduate course assistant for CS 124 (CS1 course for our CS majors), CS 233, CS 374 (Algorithms and Models of Computation).</p>
            <p>In summer 2020, when I was a junior in CS at UIUC, I worked for <a href="https://girlswhocode.com">Girls Who Code</a> as a teaching assistant. It was quite a fulfilling and inspiring experience, which eventually led me to the route of studying CS education and wanting to becoome a CS professor.</p>
